# Shortest Path Solver
## Introduction

This repository provides a solver for the Shortest Path Problem (SPP), which aims to find the path with the minimum cost or length from a specific source node to a sink node in a network. We utilize Dijkstra's Algorithm, an exact-solution algorithm, to calculate the shortest distance from the source node to all connected nodes in the graph, ensuring optimal solutions for the SPP. Two different codes are proposed in order to approach the Dijkstra's Algorithm, one using an own function and the other using a heap function. 

**Features**
Solve the Shortest Path Problem using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Find the minimum cost or length path from a source node to a sink node.
Provide optimal solutions for the SPP.
Efficiently calculate the shortest distances from the source node to all connected nodes in the graph.

## Technologies Used
In this project, I utilized Python as my primary programming language to program all the steps for the DijkstraÂ´s 's Algorithm.
